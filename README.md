See the [Installation Page](http://repetae.net/computer/jhc/building.shtml) for information about downloading and installing jhc.

For information on running jhc, see [The User's Manual](http://repetae.net/computer/jhc/manual.html).

Join the [jhc mailing list](http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/jhc) for jhc discussion, announcements, and bug reports.

There is a [spot on the wiki](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Jhc) but it doesn't have much info yet. feel free to expand it.

# Developing Jhc

The [development page](http://repetae.net/computer/jhc/development.shtml) has information on how to pull the development tree from the darcs repository

The [bug tracker](http://repetae.net/computer/jhc/bug) tracks known jhc issues, bugs can be added by submitting darcs patches or just posting to the mailing list jhc@haskell.org. NOTE: [Issues on this github mirror](https://github.com/jimcrayne/jhc/issues) will also be forwarded to the mailing list.

An informal graph of the internal code motion in jhc is [here](http://repetae.net/computer/jhc/big-picture.pdf).
